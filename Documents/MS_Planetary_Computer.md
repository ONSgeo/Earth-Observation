# Microsoft Planetary Computer

## Introduction

<a href="https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Planetary Computer</a> is a free, cloud-based engine for processing earth observation data using APIs in Python and R.

## Using Planetary Computer

How you use Planetary Computer will depend on what GIS tools you are comfortable with. Currently, it offers Python, R, and QGIS (experimental) capabilities. However, it seems to run R within a Jupyter notebook. Currently unsure of what impact this has on running R, but given it can connect to an R kernal this might not be an issue?
