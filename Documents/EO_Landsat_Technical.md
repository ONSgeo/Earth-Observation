### Landsat Satellites Band Designation

The sensors aboard each of the Landsat satellites were designed to acquire data in different ranges of frequencies along the electromagnetic spectrum. The Multispectral Scanner (MSS) carried on Landsat 1,2,3,4 and 5 collected data in four ranges (bands); the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 included those found on earlier satellites and also introduced a thermal and a shortwave infrared band. A panchromatic band was added to Landsat 7â€™s Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor.

While the earlier satellites carried just one sensor, Landsat 8 acquires data in 11 bands from two separate sensors: the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS).  The instruments on Landsat 9 are being designed as improved copies of Landsat 8.

#### Landsat 1-5 Multispectral Scanner

Landsat 1-5 Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images consist of four spectral bands with 60 meter spatial resolution. Approximate scene size is 170 km north-south by 185 km east-west (106 mi by 115 mi). Specific band designations differ from Landsat 1-3 to Landsat 4-5.
