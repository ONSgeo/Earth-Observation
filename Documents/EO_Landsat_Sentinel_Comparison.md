# Comparison between Landsat bands and Sentinel-2A’s MultiSpectral Instrument

### Radiometric Characteristics: 
The Sentinel-2A data has spectral bands very similar to Landsat 8 (excluding the thermal bands of Landsat 8’s Thermal Infrared Sensor). The specific placement of the Sentinel-2A bands, as compared to Landsat 7 and 8 bands, can be seen in the graphic below.
