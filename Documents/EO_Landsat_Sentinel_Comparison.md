# Comparison between Landsat bands and Sentinel-2A’s MultiSpectral Instrument

### Radiometric Characteristics: 
The Sentinel-2A data has spectral bands very similar to Landsat 8 (excluding the thermal bands of Landsat 8’s Thermal Infrared Sensor). The specific placement of the Sentinel-2A bands, as compared to Landsat 7 and 8 bands, can be seen in the graphic below.

The main visible and near-infrared Sentinel-2A bands have a spatial resolution of 10 meters, while its “red-edge” (red and near-infrared bands) and two shortwave infrared bands have a 20-meter spatial resolution. The coastal/aerosol, water vapor, and cirrus bands have a spatial resolution of 60 meters.

During the development of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A, calibration scientists from both projects worked together to cross-calibrate the sensors.

The [USGS Spectral Characteristics Viewer](https://landsat.usgs.gov/spectral-characteristics-viewer) helps users determine which spectral bands work best to identify their features of interest for image interpretation.
