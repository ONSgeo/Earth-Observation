#### Sentinel

The Sentinel mission is operated by the European Space Agency. It consists of 7 dual-satellite constellations. The mission is part of the fulfillment of the Copernicus programme.

Access to Sentinel mission data is available via the <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Open Access Hub</a>. Currently there is open access available for Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 via a free user account. Currently only pre-operational -5p data is available and this has a separate GUI/API for access and via premade guest credentials. Pre-operational products for Sentinel 1, 2, and 3 are also available.

## How EO is being used/Case studies

Both expected AND unexpected

### SDGs

* Air pollution/Water pollution
* Economic development

### Academic

* Research Articles

### Private

* OS
* Overall private sector e.g. oil

### Government

* Gov depts e.g. DEFRA
* Military

Clear case for use of EO data to support many government projects.
