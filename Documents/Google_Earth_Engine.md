## Google Earth Engine (GEE) 

GEE is a cloud-based platform for massive-scale analysis of geospatial data. GEE allows users access to a petabyte-scale archive of publicly available remotely sensed imagery, ancillary data and computational tools to accomplish a myriad of remote sensing and geospatial tasks at unprecedented speeds and scales. GEE is free for non-commercial use provided users sign up for a GEE account.

## Earth Engine (EE) Code Editor

Earth Engine is available through Python and JavaScript Application Program Interfaces (APIs). The JavaScript API is accessible via a webbased Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called the Code Editor. Through  this platform users can write and execute scripts to share and repeat geospatial analysis and processing workflows. The
Code Editor  [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) offers access to the full power of Earth Engine. 

Even with a GEE account, you will require a Google Cloud Titan security key to access the EE code editor. One can obtain this key through ONS Service Desk. 

## Google Colaboratory 'Colab'

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with:

Zero configuration required,
Free access to GPUs, and 
Easy sharing

Colab is the Python alternative to Earth Engine Javascript API which is the default Earth Engine (EE) code editor web-based IDE.
