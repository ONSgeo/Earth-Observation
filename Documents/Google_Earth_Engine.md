## Google Earth Engine (GEE) 

GEE is a cloud-based platform for massive-scale analysis of geospatial data. GEE allows users access to a petabyte-scale archive of publicly available remotely sensed imagery, ancillary data and computational tools to accomplish a myriad of remote sensing and geospatial tasks at unprecedented speeds and scales. GEE is free for non-commercial use provided users sign up for a GEE account.

## Earth Engine (EE) Code Editor

Earth Engine is available through Python and JavaScript Application Program Interfaces (APIs). The JavaScript API is accessible via a webbased Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called the Code Editor. Through  this platform users can write and execute scripts to share and repeat geospatial analysis and processing workflows. To access Code Editor one can navigate to the URL [https://code.earthengine.google.com/](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) on Google Chrome web browser. 

In order to access the EE Code Editor using the ONS custom google account, you will require a Google Cloud Titan security key. One can obtain the key through Service Desk. 

## Google Colaboratory 'Colab'

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with:

Zero configuration required,
Free access to GPUs, and 
Easy sharing

Colab is the Python alternative to Earth Engine Javascript API which is the default Earth Engine (EE) code editor web-based IDE.
