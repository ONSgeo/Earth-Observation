# Earth-Observation

### Background
Resources on the use of Earth observation data in ONS Geo team

This repo is designed to be kept 'private'. 

Code in this repo has been created or researched by members of the team and saved here so that it can be re-used in other projects. The code itself is not regularly maintained so if issues with the code are identified please either contact the [ONS Geography inbox](ONS.Geography@ons.gov.uk) if you are not in the geo-team. If you are in the geospatial team please create a branch on the code you are updating.
